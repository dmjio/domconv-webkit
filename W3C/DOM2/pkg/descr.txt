DOM Level 2 bindings for the WebBits package.
This package provides monadic smart constructors for Javascript syntax representation
implemented in the "WebBits" package. Most of this package's code was autogenerated from IDL files
available from the Web Consortium. See e. g. 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/idl-definitions.html>
These constructors help generate WebBits representation of Javascript code that works with
methods and attributes of DOM objects in typesafe manner using monadic notation of Haskell.
.
See documentation for the "Data.DOM" module for more information and a brief usage example.
.
In the package version number, the version major reflects the level of DOM specification
for which bindings are provided.
