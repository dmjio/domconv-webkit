DOM Level 2 bindings for the WebBits package.
This package provides monadic smart constructors for Javascript syntax representation
found in the "WebBits" package. Most of this package's code was autogenerated from IDL files
available from the Web Consortium. See e. g. <http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/>
These constructors help generate WebBits representation of Javascript code that uses
methods and attributes of DOM objects in typesafe manner using monadic notation of Haskell.
.
See documentation for the "Data.DOM" module for more information.

In the package version number, the major number reflects the level of DOM specification
for which bindings are provided.
